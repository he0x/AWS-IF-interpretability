This is the supporting notebook for the research paper â€” **Why Are You Weird? Infusing Interpretability in Isolation Forest for Anomaly Detection**

Both commented code of the experiments and the results are reproduced at full in this notebook. 

Since this is the first release of the implementation of the *Assist-Based Weighting Scheme (AWS)*, which powers our model-specific local explanation method for the Isolation Forest learner, it can be optimized further.
